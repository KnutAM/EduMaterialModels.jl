# EduMaterialModels

This package contains basic material models for educational purposes following the [`MaterialModelsBase`](https://github.com/KnutAM/MaterialModelsBase.jl) interface. 

Short doc-strings are available for each [material model](@ref Material-models), 
and other [utility functions](@ref Utility-functions) for running simulations. 
However, the main purpose is to demonstrate the different material behaviors using 
[`Pluto`](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks. The following notebooks are available:
