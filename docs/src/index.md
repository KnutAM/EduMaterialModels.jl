# EduMaterialModels

This package contains basic material models for educational purposes following the [`MaterialModelsBase`](https://github.com/KnutAM/MaterialModelsBase.jl) interface. 

Short doc-strings are available for each [material model](@ref Material-models), 
and other [utility functions](@ref Utility-functions) for running simulations. 
However, the main purpose is to demonstrate the different material behaviors using 
[`Pluto`](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks. 
A static representation of the notebooks can be found in the sidebar, 
and the full notebooks are available for downloading in the list below.
Note that while opening these in binder for running online is simple, 
it takes quite a long time to open and start up that service!
